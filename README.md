# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
As a new hire (data analyst) at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, I was assigned to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. After going through various steps of creating an extrensive presentation, I was asked to do some additional analysis and create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results of the Pyber Analysis:

### Summary Dataframe

In our summary dataframe below by city type, we can see that the Rural cities have less number of rides and drivers compared to the suburban and Urban cities but that lets the drivers charge a higher price per ride per drive in comparison to the Urban and Suburban cities.

When we further drill down the analysis and look at how the city types compare on a weekly basis we notice that our multiple-line chart has a peak or dip in the line graphs at each week. Its specially interesting to notice that even with a weekly peak and dip, our urban city graph in general is an upward moving graph in comparison to the suburban and rural cities.

### Summary: 

Based on the outcome of our analysis we have three business recommendations for the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

- Increase the number of drivers in the rural cities because right now the driver/ride ratio is much higher than that of the suburban and urban cities. This may be causing the riders on average to wait longer for a requested ride.

- Currently the rural area drivers are making 3 times and suburban drivers are making 2 times of what the urban area drivers are making per ride. Generally the urban area distances are shorter that might be leading to lower fare per ride. There is an opportunity to increase the fare per driver by about $2 in the urban area that can lead directly to an overall increase of about $3200.

- As compared to rural and suburban areas, number of rides per driver in urban area cities is significantly lower. We recomend more marketing be done in the urban areas to attract more riders.
