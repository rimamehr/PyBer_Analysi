# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
As a new hire (data analyst) at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion I was assigned to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. After going through various steps of creating an extrensive presentation, I was asked to do some additional analysis and create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results of the Pyber Analysis:

### Summary Dataframe

In our summary dataframe below by city type, we can see that the Rural cities have less number of rides and drivers compared to the suburban and Urban cities but that lets the drivers charge a higher price per ride per drive in comparison to the Urband and Suburban cities.
