# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
As a new hire (data analyst) at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion I was assigned to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. After going through various steps of creating an extrensive presentation, I was asked to do some additional analysis and create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
